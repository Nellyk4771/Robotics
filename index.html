This week I designed a online plan for a robot thats able to go through a obstical,
a engineering designed golf picker upper and transporter, and today I made my own 
website that I am able to coding on to.</p></H4>

   <H5>This week we worked on designing a problem solving ideas and designs 
   to fix our or enviormental problems. Later on in the week we thought 
   of ideas to advertise the schools robotics competetive team.</H5> </html>

     This week on Monday to Wensday we worked on researching and designing 
our own problem solving device.Then on thursday we did a group challenge 
of differnt levels of passing and catching different size plastic poles. 
Today, friday we are coding what we did this week on this website and 
increasing our idea of the problem solving device. </H5>

Here is a video of my Bridge design from last semester:

     To start off the week we learned about a new type of engineering called
  biological engineering. We learned how it can be used in the world to help
  the enviorment and people with daily tasks. Later on in the week we had a 
  debet invovling a broken train brake with two differnt ways to go, either left 
  and hit five people tied on or right with one person tied on. We rewiewed all the 
  possibltites of how, who, what of both situtations. Then on thursday we did another 
  group challege of designing an egineering tool to help fix a problem at the school.
  Today I am working on my enviormental self design and upload my website on what 
  I did this week. </H5>

          This week I finalized my project and listed the materials I need for my 
      earthquake prevention project. We also tried learning how to weld in the robotics 
      room which looks very cool. Then one Friday/ today we updated our websites and worked
      on our projects.

This week in Robotics we started off by finishing our welding letters, then updated 
our websites. Now, today I am working on finishing up my designing/ planning for 
my project.</H5>

The week before spring break, (3 weeks ago) we worked on an egg drop challenge. My group thought of the idea of using an cabage 
to give a protective layer while not being to hard to drop and break the egg. In the start of 
this week we started by learning the safty of most tools. We also had a presentar from the 
mecanical engineering major talk about his project to make soliders with tremor to be about 
to drink coffee without spilling and looking like a normal person. Then on thursday we drawed
freeway roads to see how well it works with traffic, how much concreate was used, and if every 
car was able to go to where they needed. Today, (Friday) we updated our website sites, and 
most of our supplies for our problem solving project have arrived. 

Here is the images of the egg drop process and results.

Last week I worked on starting to building the walls for my buildings. I have 
complete 1/3 of a a side of a wall as the pattern inside the wall for strucual 
support takes long to make.</H8>

<H8> 4/8/22
This week I conutined to work on my walls for my project. Later on in the week 
we went down to the Robotics room and worked on getting our things we needed to 
get cut, cut. </H8>

<H8> 4/15/22
This week we got to continue working on our projects in the robotics room. I 
got all my supplies I needed and finished one of the walls.</H8>

<H5> This week we contuined to work on our individual projects and on thursday 
we worked with parnters to build a boat with 2 pieces of paper and a object 
in which we wrapped the paper with a box that had air to float. I learned 

<H4> This week I contined working on my project then on thursday we did a 
thursday. The challenge was to get a water ballon from start to end of 100m 
without poping. We created a sandwhich like device with a rubber band to help 
rubber againsit rubber stay better. </H4>

<H3> 5/6/22 
This week we contunued to work on our projects. On Thursday we had a challege 
to see if there are more doors or wheels. After going around school counting, 
and getting relable information we estimated that the school has more doors. 
Today we are going yo clean and update our websites. </H3>

<H3> 5/13/22
This week I completed my building for my project in which I will now work on 
how to test my theroy. On thursday we did a thursday challenge; the challenge 
was to create model with a box, yarn, and rubber bands to throw a water ballon. 
Today we worked on wrting words to make sentences, cleaning the robotics room, 
and updating our websites. Here are some pictures from thursday.

This week we worked on engineering problems, and our projects. On thursday we 
had a challege to think of the best way to build a model blind folded with the 
help of our partner. Here are some images.

    This week I finshed up my contruction of the buildings, and only need to 
finsh making the tool to shake it. For the thursday challenge we started to work 
on our final. The challenge was to make a boat for two people out of a group of 
three have to do a race with the other teams in the pool. We started working on 
designs for it on thursday, and will work on it next week.</H4>
