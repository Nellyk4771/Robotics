This week I designed a online plan for a robot thats able to go through a obstical,
a engineering designed golf picker upper and transporter, and today I made my own

     This week on Monday to Wensday we worked on researching and designing 
our own problem solving device.Then on thursday we did a group challenge 
of differnt levels of passing and catching different size plastic poles. 
Today, friday we are coding what we did this week on this website and 
increasing our idea of the problem solving device. </H5>

Here is a video of my Bridge design from last semester:

     To start off the week we learned about a new type of engineering called
  biological engineering. We learned how it can be used in the world to help
  the enviorment and people with daily tasks. Later on in the week we had a 
  debet invovling a broken train brake with two differnt ways to go, either left 
  and hit five people tied on or right with one person tied on. We rewiewed all the 
  possibltites of how, who, what of both situtations. Then on thursday we did another 
  group challege of designing an egineering tool to help fix a problem at the school.
  Today I am working on my enviormental self design and upload my website on what 
  I did this week. </H5>

          This week I finalized my project and listed the materials I need for my 
      earthquake prevention project. We also tried learning how to weld in the robotics 
      room which looks very cool. Then one Friday/ today we updated our websites and worked
      on our projects.
